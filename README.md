# 🌍 Global Sugarcane Production EDA

A data analysis project exploring sugarcane production trends globally across various countries using Python and data visualization libraries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing sugarcane production statistics from different countries. It aims to uncover insights related to productivity, yield efficiency, regional performance, and per capita production.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global sugarcane production and identify top-producing countries.
- Understand yield variations across continents.
- Investigate the relationship between acreage and production.
- Explore production per capita for economic/agricultural insights.
- Visualize findings using plots and charts.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Fields:**
  - Country
  - Continent
  - Production (Tons)
  - Production per Person (Kg)
  - Acreage (Hectare)
  - Yield (Kg/Hectare)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Note:** Some values are in European number formatting (e.g., `1.234.567` and `"45.678,9"`), so data cleaning is essential.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Key Insights (Sample)

- **Brazil** leads global production, followed by **India** and **China**.
- Countries like **Guatemala** and **Egypt** show high yield efficiency despite smaller acreage.
- **Per capita production** is highest in small island nations like **Saint Kitts and Nevis**, due to low population and focused agriculture.
